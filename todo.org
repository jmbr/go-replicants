#+TITLE: Molecular simulator TODO list.
#+STARTUP: showall
#+OPTIONS: toc:0

* Bugs
** TODO Restructure the memory layout of the contact maps because we no longer consider adjacent atoms as forming a native contact.
** TODO The parameter d_max should only be taken into account in the potential function when |i - j| >= 4.
** TODO Thoroughly test the contact map and potential energy modules.
** TODO How can it be that in spite of a RMSD of 2.1A there are still about 20 native contacts yet to be formed?
* Pending
** Optimize computation of the potential function
*** Is a Verlet list feasible? Nope.
*** It may be possible to compute only the differences between potentials instead of the whole potential and then 
*** It can be computed in parallel (use #pragma omp for reduce(U:+) )
** TODO Optimize overlapping detection code
** TODO Review the triple scalar product.
Is it possible to compute its sign without computing the whole value?
Actually, we want to determine whether a basis o vectors is positively
oriented or not.  It might be better to use a determinant or a
function that computes its sign directly.
** TODO Review code
** TODO Heat capacity (C_v) calculation
** TODO Cross-compile to Win32
** TODO Replace applications of rotation matrices by calls to BLAS' DROT
** TODO See if there is something wrong with the RMSD and implement Rg
It might be that RMSD uses an affinity while we need an euclidean transformation.
* Finished
** DONE Implement capability to resume simulations
** DONE Automatically plot and refresh energies
